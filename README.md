# Description

This project developed as a task for WebBarg, is designed to facilitate the collection and visualization of user data based on geographical locations. The system allows users to select a country, which dynamically loads the associated cities. Upon entering the required information and submitting the form, the data is saved in the database.

## Features

### 1. Dynamic City Loading

- Upon selecting a country, the corresponding cities are dynamically loaded into the form.

### 2. Database Integration

- All data, including user information, is stored and retrieved from the database.

### 3. AJAX Data Handling

- Data storage, retrieval, and interaction within the form are seamlessly handled using AJAX for a smooth user experience.

### 4. Search Functionality

- Users can search within the list of cities using AJAX, enhancing the usability of the system.

### 5. Interactive Chart

- The system includes a chart on the left side that dynamically updates based on the loaded or searched data.
- The chart displays the percentage distribution of users across different cities.

### 6. City-Based Percentage Distribution

- Each area on the chart is divided based on the number of available cities.
- The size of each area is determined by the percentage of users in that city, providing a visual representation of user distribution.
